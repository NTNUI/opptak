## Development

### Environment variables

Make a copy of `.env.example` and name it `.env`  
When using docker you don't need to do any modifications for developing locally.

### Start the backend and a database

(Requires docker installed and the environment variables from the step above)

Start the backend and a local database:  
`make start`

Start the backend and a local database with clean dummy data:  
`make fresh`

Stop and remove backend and local database:  
`make clean`

---

#### Commands if not using makefile:

Install and run the backend using `docker compose up --build`  
If you want to populate your local database with dummy data from the fixtures use `docker compose --profile fresh up --build` instead.
